Software for Processing XPS Spectra
by Giorgio Speranza

==> RxpsG version 3.2 is derived from version 2.3-2. Now the software directly uses
the TclTk functions to generate the GUIs.
Packages gWidgets2, gWidgets2tcltk, and memoise are no more necessary reducing 
the RxpsG requirements. 
The software was controlled and is continuously corrected/updated. 
However, still some bugs could be present: contact speranza@fbk.eu for problems.  

==> Previous version RxpsG 2.3-2
Number of bugs fixed, more robust code for working in Windows and Linux operating systems
Complete documentation of the S4-classes and methods, and of all the functions.
